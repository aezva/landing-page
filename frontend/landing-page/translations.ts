Here's a preview of the upcoming implementations we're developing to take NIA to the next level:\n\n<h2>New Specializations for NIA</h2>\nCurrently, NIA specializes in sales and customer service. But soon, you'll be able to choose its role: do you want it as a financial advisor? Marketing manager? Technical support? The goal is for NIA to handle most key areas of your business, with knowledge adapted to each industry.\n\n<h2>Integrations with Your Favorite Tools</h2>\nWe want NIA to connect with the rest of your ecosystem: CRM, email marketing, Google Calendar, Stripe, Airtable, and more. This way it can not only converse but act directly on your workflows. Real automation without friction.\n\n<h2>Voice Access and New Channels</h2>\nWe're working on the possibility of interacting with NIA by voice, whether on the web or from external apps like WhatsApp or Instagram. We want it to be more accessible, more natural, and available where your customers are.\n\nThese are just some of the many ideas we're working on. Our mission is clear: to make NIA a true ally for your business, an intelligent assistant that doesn't just respond... but acts, learns, and grows with you.\n\n<button>Join today and be part of this revolution</button>"

Necesitan inteligencia real que entienda lo que pasa, que actúe con propósito, y que no dependa de flujos complicados ni scripts infinitos para dar resultados.\n\nNIA no es un juguete ni una moda. Es el primer paso hacia una nueva generación de asistentes que no solo responden… sino que piensan, ayudan, y trabajan contigo como un verdadero miembro del equipo.\n\nMi compromiso es que NIA no deje de mejorar. Cada semana avanzamos en nuevas capacidades, siempre con un objetivo: que cada negocio, grande o pequeño, tenga acceso a una inteligencia tan capaz como humana, pero más disponible, más constante y más estratégica.\n\nGracias por creer en lo que estamos construyendo. Esto recién empieza.\n\n\nAlvar Pachec"

          description: "Desde su nacimiento, NIA fue concebida para evolucionar. Lo que hoy ves en el MVP ya es poderoso, pero lo que viene después es lo que realmente cambiará las reglas del juego. Aquí te compartimos un adelanto de las próximas implementaciones que estamos desarrollando para llevar a NIA a un nuevo nivel:\n\n<h2>Nuevas especialidades para NIA</h2>\nActualmente, NIA se especializa en ventas y atención al cliente. Pero pronto, podrás elegir su rol: ¿la quieres como asesora financiera? ¿gestora de marketing? ¿soporte técnico? El objetivo es que NIA pueda ocuparse de la mayoría de áreas clave de tu negocio, con conocimientos adaptados a cada industria.\n\n<h2>Integraciones con tus herramientas favoritas</h2>\nQueremos que NIA se conecte con el resto de tu ecosistema: CRM, email marketing, Google Calendar, Stripe, Airtable y más. Así podrá no solo conversar, sino actuar directamente sobre tus flujos de trabajo. Automatización real sin fricción.\n\n<h2>Acceso por voz y nuevos canales</h2>\nEstamos trabajando en la posibilidad de que interactúes con NIA por voz, ya sea en la web o desde apps externas como WhatsApp o Instagram. Queremos que sea más accesible, más natural, y esté disponible donde estén tus clientes.\n\nEstas son solo algunas de las muchas ideas en las que estamos trabajando. Nuestra misión es clara: hacer de NIA una verdadera aliada para tu negocio, una asistente inteligente que no solo responda… sino que actúe, aprenda y crezca contigo.\n\n<button>Únete hoy y forma parte de esta revolución</button>"
